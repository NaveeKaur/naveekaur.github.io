The purpose of this assignment was to write a chapter for an instruction manual about a topic the audience may be familiar with, but unknown to them in a specific context. </p>

<p>As a biologist, I have always advocated for a pollution-free environment, so I chose to write a chapter on composting waste. I wrote the entirety of this document myself and all of my references are cited from credible sources, with Figure 1 as the exception; Figure 1 is composed of imaginary data, as this was one of the requirements of this assignment. </p>

<p>This document highlights my growth from being a technical writing student to becoming the first official Technical Writing Tutor in the Writing and Communication Center at the University. The Process &amp; Instruction assignment is considered to be the most difficult in the class by many of the students I have tutored because it requires the student to identify the difference between process writing and instruction, and then apply this knowledge to use a combination of the two to write a manual; process writing tells you why things are the way they are, like a textbook, reference book, or user's guide, while instructions give you step-by-step how to instructions on how to perform a task.  Personally, this was my favorite assignment to tutor because I had the opportunity to guide students through the process of distinguishing the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ of their topics. I also provided many students a copy of this document as a reference for their writing. One of the highlights of working as a Technical Writing Tutor was having a student tell me that my guidance helped him use better documentation practices in his internship, and that using my paper as a reference helped him improve his grade in this course overall. </p>

<p> In short, my Process &amp; Instruction assignment, below, was one of the ways I showed engineering students how technical writing can be applied to the workplace. It also served as a reference to students to help them with their assignment.
