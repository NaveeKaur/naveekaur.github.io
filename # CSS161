## Projects from CSS 161 (Intro to Programming I) at UWB 

### Summary of Projects 
* HW1: Project to read in a series of fractions from a text file, which will have each line formatted “A/B”.  When all output is consumed, the program will print out a list of each unique fraction value, and the number of occurrences in the file. No blank lines or misleading characters. 
	* *Fraction* holds the information for a single fraction.  
	* *FractionCounter* keeps count of how many times a fraction has occurred in the input file.  
	* *Driver* contains a method that takes as an argument the file to read, will read the file, create the appropriate classes, and print out the results.

* HW2: A tool to capture product information for a new website selling cosmetics, with each product category represented by a Java class. The application will prompt the user for the product information and will collect and then print the catalog info for the products being sold ( Mascara, Foundation, and SunBlockFoundation). 
	* *InventoryItem* is the base class for all inventory items.
	* *Mascara* is derived from *InventoryItem*. 
	* *Foundation* is derived from *InventoryItem*. 
	* *SunBlockFoundation* is derived from *Foundation*. 
	* *Driver* creates an ArrayList<InventoyItem> that holds the products. 


* HW3: Three classes (Money, Date and Bill) for use in managing a set of outstanding and paid bills.
	* *Money* class is used to track a USD amount consisting of two integers to manage dollars and cents.  All amounts will be positive or 0.
	* *Date* class represents a date in our world. No built in date classes used. 
	* *Bill* class represents an outstanding or paid bill. It contains the amount of the bill as a *Money* object, the due date of the bill as a *Date* object, and a *Date* object to track the date paid (null if not yet paid).
	* Test driver uses the jUnit framework.


* HW4: Fun little assignment on Shape inheritance. 

* HW5: A class and a driver for use in searching through a file hierarchy (a tree) for a specified file.  
	* The *FindFile* class searches a directory (and all subdirectories) for a target file name. 

* HW6: Three classes (LinearSearch ,BinarySearch, RecursiveBinarySearch ) that inherit from the provided parent class SearchAlgorithm, and a fourth exception class ItemNotFoundException. Each of the subclasses classes implement only one public method that facilitates the appropriate search over an array of Strings. The exception class services these searches in the event the item isn’t found in the String array.

* HW7: Three classes that implement a *Linked List*, a *Stack*, and a *Queue* using a doubly linked list.  The *Stack* and *Queue* inherit from  the *LList* class ( a linked list implementation) and a simple *LinkedListException* class will be thrown in place of *RuntimeExceptions* whenever exceptional or error situations occur.

* HW8: Using the provided interface (SetInterface.java), created a Generic Set class which implements the SetInterface and a test driver in jUnit that tests the Set class.

* HW9: **Final Poject!** A reservation system to reserve tables in a resturant and hairdressers in a salon.
